## Bank Financial Record Analysis

### Background

In this project, I created two python notebooks; first is intended for data-preparation and second for further data analysis.  

In this end-to-end analysis,  I learned to import modules to read csv to pandas dataframe, format datatypes, combined mutli-dataframes using the concatenation and groupby method, merge of dataframes using the full-outer merge, adding of columns and at the same dropping of columns, visualized to understand the data, check and handle missing values, check for duplicates, munged data for time-series analysis and visualized to discover **Trend**, **Seasonal**, and **Cyclical** patterns, create machine-learning model to **predict revenue using Simple Uni-Variate Regression Analysis**. I also used Tableau for data blending, and to create pretty visualization and interactive dashboard.

This challenge encompasses real-world situation where my Python and data science skills can come in handy.

Tools used to analyze data and create visualization and interactive dashboard:

* Python Pandas

* Matplotlib and Seaborn

* Tableau for data blending and Visualization

* Sckit-Learn for data-prep in Machine Learning.

* Keras for Machine Learning model
